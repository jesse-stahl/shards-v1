## Universal prototype evidence

- Validate the structured package and bind the exact clean source revision, declared files, dependency lock, and review
  target.
- Resolve the trusted intake workflow, target base, validator, allowed package files, skill, criteria, and fee-policy
  revisions. Test that package-contract drift fails closed and is attributed to the platform instead of guessed away.
- Re-resolve every public numeric repository id, commit, tree, submodule and LFS object anonymously. Delete/recreate the
  same slug, change visibility, remove the bound ref, and make an object unavailable; prior positive evidence must fail.
- Build and test every declared implementation surface with its pinned language, compiler or runtime, package manager,
  and configuration.
- Test the authorities, value flows, configuration bounds, state transitions, events or observable outputs, failures,
  recovery paths, and exits the design actually introduces.
- Use adversarial cases, fuzzing, stateful invariants, static analysis, and resource-bound tests where the declared
  capability and risk require them.
- Build a per-tool coverage matrix with explicit blocked/no-data/inconclusive states. Disable all analyzers and return
  empty output; the aggregate result must stay unproved rather than clean. Reproduce scanner candidates before severity.
- Record code, test, and assertion authorship. Same-run generated tests do not complete an independent-review gate;
  require a maintainer-controlled clean-clone semantic reproduction before positive final verification.
- Bind trust-boundary evidence to immutable run-scoped artifacts and a manifest. Mutate source, workflow, policy/tool
  digests, manifest, and artifact bytes, and race shared output paths; replayed or mismatched attestations must fail.
- Give every dependency a stable id and test the applicable source, chain, address, interface, runtime, deployment,
  upgrade, freshness, failure, and fallback assumptions.
- Create product-integration test plans for every intended UI, game, service, API, indexer, quote, trade, claim, keeper,
  oracle, and monitoring surface.
- Mutate or omit every launch-plan target, dependency edge, ABI argument, address locator, salt, initialization value,
  allocation, liquidity/custody step, platform capability id, and postcondition; the plan must fail closed.
- Substitute a wrong interface-compatible component before, during, and after every one-shot wiring operation; no
  partial state or value-moving path may survive. Preoccupy each predicted CREATE2 address, mutate deployer runtime,
  initcode, constructor arguments and permission bits, then prove rejection, rollback, and clean retry.
- Test every documented numeric and temporal bound immediately below, at, and above the limit plus overflow-adjacent
  values through every constructor, initializer, setter, upgrade, and derived configuration path.
- Give a victim a standing ERC-20 allowance and let an attacker choose payer, beneficiary, token, amount, launch/config
  hash, PoolKey/hook/router, chain, verifying contract, nonce, and deadline. Test direct caller funding, typed delegation,
  Permit2, ERC-1271, revocation, partial spend, residual allowance, refund ownership, front-running, and replay.
- For later execution rails, test default-simulation behavior and authorization replay across chain, target, bundle,
  signer, nonce range, limits, and expiry. Reject secrets in argv/logs/artifacts and occupied-address adoption unless
  runtime, configuration, permissions, PoolManager, PoolKey, deployer, and receipt all match.

Mark a lifecycle action or capability family `not applicable` only with a reason and a test, source inspection, schema
constraint, or structural argument showing why it cannot be reached. Do not add an implementation language or report a
tool result merely to fill a section.

## Autopilot and reviewer calibration

- Run a cold one-prompt reconstruction from the public idea and exact skill. Require the same business objective,
  economic model, onchain and offchain boundary, component ownership, capabilities and protected properties without
  private chat, category names or expected verdict. An unresolved material assumption blocks prototype readiness.
- Repeat the cold prompt with irrelevant optional specialists present, absent and renamed. Require the same working
  kernel, selected architecture, capabilities and gate result; allow only attributable evidence availability to differ.
  No specialist may change product intent, fixed fee policy, external-action authority or approval state.
- Remove each component and product surface from the first vertical slice. Prove every retained hook, contract, token,
  oracle, app, indexer, service, keeper and admin is necessary for the promised closed loop, protected property,
  operation or admission evidence; reject missing lifecycle steps and speculative generated breadth.
- For measurement or probability-driven behavior, vary raw observations independently from estimator output, market
  price and the enforced fee, limit, allocation or payout. Cover forgery, replay, correction, stale or outage, extreme
  values, front-running, post-exposure rule changes, insolvency, dispute, cancel, refund and terminal-unresolved state as
  applicable. A safe bounded rule and an insolvent mutation must not share a verdict.

## Solidity contracts, when declared

- Prove the compiler-resolved source and import closure, exact compiler/EVM/settings, dependency revisions, build
  artifacts, and runtime or deployment expectations.
- Test configuration, authorization, arithmetic, events, bounds, reverts, hostile tokens, reentrancy, and applicable
  value-conservation properties.
- For every ERC-20 path, test false, no, and malformed returns plus fee-on-transfer, rebasing, callback, paused, and
  blocklisted behavior as supported or explicit rejection. Reconcile requested, sent, received, credited, and settled
  amounts.
- Record static-analysis dispositions plus applicable fuzz, invariant, pinned-fork, current-head smoke, gas, runtime-size,
  and initcode-size evidence.

## Custom hook, only when `hook.used` is true

- Reproduce all 14 permission flags, the derived mask, deployment method, salt/initcode when CREATE2 applies, and the
  expected hook address.
- Test PoolManager and PoolKey authentication, callback selector and return length, parent permission, sender meaning,
  hookData policy, nested/self-call suppression, and revert atomicity for every enabled callback.
- Cover all four quadrants as supported or explicitly rejected before value/state/liability movement. Test direct hook,
  router, quoter and shipped UI boundaries so an unsupported mode cannot become a bypass.
- Test operation-specific settlement, final-zero deltas without asset disappearance, forbidden `clear` of owed value,
  ERC-6909 solvency, rounding, partial fills, final combined caller limits, valid zero-core-AMM custom accounting,
  invalid unbacked/no-op deltas, and failure atomicity.
- For dynamic fees, test initialization, application mode, override flag, persistent actor and call sites, update path,
  rate limit, bounds, observation, cadence, manipulation, liquidity decrease, and failure.
- For hook-owned charges, test the collection path, value-flow id, liability keys, event, recipient sums and bindings,
  duplicates, zero and failed recipients, claims, redirects, address mutation, and historic entitlements.

## Mandatory Programmable fee, for every launch-ready prototype

- Prove `effective=max(selected,10 bps)`, with selected totals of zero, below the floor, at the floor, and above it.
- Prove `3% selected = 0.1% Programmable + 2.9% project`, never an additive `3.1%`.
- Test every successful supported token-to-quote/quote-to-token exactness mode on the exact canonical PoolKey and prove
  every unsupported quadrant rejects before value, state, liability, quote, router, or UI movement.
- Prove the declared before-swap path when quote is specified and after-swap path when quote is unspecified. Test that
  hook-initiated same-pool swaps revert or accrue the identical fee through a source-proven internal path.
- Use actually executed gross quote-side volume after partial fills; test rounding, dust, reconciliation, and events.
- Prove LP fees, token taxes, router paths, app payments, donations, and alternative pools neither satisfy nor bypass it.
- Prove only immutable owner `0x4957f49620AFf3Adbbe8195a4f633E49cc93376c` can claim, anytime, to itself or an
  owner-selected destination for that claim. Reject builder, project, administrator, recipient, arbitrary caller,
  rescue, sweep, stored-recipient mutation, and owner mutation paths.
- Prove the fee accrues as a claimable liability and is not merely auto-transferred; reconcile accrual, partial and full
  claims, remaining availability, and backing.
- Prove `(poolId,currency,owner)` liability solvency and isolation with no cross-pool netting.
- Bind exact source and test paths to `programmableFee.collection.hookFeeMechanismBinding` and the fee value flow.
- Compare cumulative entitlement for one aggregate swap and `N` split swaps. Trade splitting must not systematically
  erase the 10-bps fee; bind and test the carried remainder when the construction needs one.

## No-hook proposal path, when `hook.used` is false

- Prove explicit selection of `official-launchpad` or `model-specific-no-hook` and the canonical pool lifecycle. For the
  official route, bind the current pinned profile. For the model-specific route, bind its own exact source, compiler,
  dependency closure and constructor configuration without borrowing the official profile identity.
- Confirm that the declared project does not introduce custom callbacks, a hook permission mask, or a hook CREATE2
  address, and that its proposal, submission, threat model, and tests agree on that boundary.
- Test any separately declared token, app, game, service, integration, or launch configuration on its own merits. Keep
  fee collection pending and assert that the package does not claim prototype or launch readiness until the standard
  fee hook or one integrated custom hook is added.

When a `tokenMechanics` transfer tax is used with either hook route, test `buy-sell-peer-tax-rates`, `zero-tax-path`,
`immutable-maximum-tax-bound`, `recipient-split-conservation`, `exemption-boundaries`,
`poolmanager-requested-versus-received`, `poolmanager-liquidity-and-alternative-pool-classification`,
`quote-execution-received-amount`, and
`unrestricted-buy-sell-transfer-liveness`; add `authority-and-delay` when mutable. When automatic liquidity is used,
also test `auto-liquidity-threshold-boundaries`, `auto-liquidity-maximum-swap-bound`,
`auto-liquidity-slippage-and-deadline`, `auto-liquidity-reentrancy`, `auto-liquidity-failure-atomicity`, and
`lp-custody-and-exit`. Exercise provider-supported and unsupported routes without turning a local canary into approval.

## App or game, when declared

- Test rules and state transitions, wallet and signing boundaries, input validation, persistence, replay and duplicate
  actions, loading and error states, unsupported states, recovery, and any client/server trust split.
- Test intended browsers and breakpoints, keyboard and screen-reader behavior where applicable, transaction progress,
  stale or conflicting data, and user-visible value or entitlement calculations.

## Service, keeper, oracle, or indexer, when declared

- Test API and event schemas, authentication and authorization, idempotency, retries, ordering, timeouts, rate limits,
  stale data, reorgs, backfill, reconciliation, funding, failover, recovery, and denial-of-service bounds where relevant.
- Test monitoring thresholds, alert ownership, incident runbooks, degraded modes, and the effect of unavailable or
  malicious dependencies.
- For bounded observation storage, sample at the minimum allowed spacing through multiple complete wraps. Prove the
  required anchor remains representable and execution, claim, exit, and recovery remain reachable with liabilities
  intact.

## Position custody and locks, when declared

- Bind the expected token id and independently verify the canonical PoolKey or PoolId and relevant position parameters.
- Reject a valid decoy position even when it is supplied by an otherwise authorized depositor.
- Test owner, operator, approval, transfer, decrease, collect, unlock, rescue, dust, and every emergency path.

## Product integration cases

During proposal and prototype work, plan these against the intended PoolKey, model version, contract addresses, router
generation, and event schema. Mark values that are not fixed yet as unresolved. Executable product-contract tests begin
after maintainers accept the model and assign product paths.

- UI renders canonical identity, lifecycle state, balances, fees, claims, disclosures, unsupported modes, stale data,
  transaction progress, and failures from the declared source of truth
- App or game interactions preserve the declared rules, wallet boundary, persistence, value flow, failure states, and
  recovery behavior
- API request and response schemas preserve chain, model version, amount semantics, errors, freshness, and cache rules
- Services, keepers, and oracles preserve their declared trigger, authority, freshness, retry, fallback, and funding
  behavior
- Indexer replay from the declared start block survives reorgs, resumes backfill, reconciles receipts and chain reads,
  and reports lag without presenting stale state as current
- Quote and trade use the same PoolKey, direction, exactness, amount semantics, hookData when used, fee model, and proposed
  configuration; test slippage, deadlines, partial fills, native refunds, final deltas, simulation failures, and receipts
- Claim preview and execution agree on entitlement and liability keys; test caller and recipient authorization, payout
  changes, historical rights, failed recipients, retries, and displayed transaction state
- Monitoring detects contract, solvency, keeper, oracle, RPC, indexer, routing, and provider failures that apply; test
  alert ownership, fallback, escalation, and the incident runbook

Tests may prove only the surface and revision they exercise. They do not prove deployment, source verification, live
fee collection, provider approval, or production availability.

## Semantic cases

Record a worked numerical example for every fee or accounting rule the project introduces. Turn each example, its
rounding boundary, its value-conservation equation, and one failure case into a test. Classify all four quadrants. The
mandatory fee covers every successful supported mode; each unsupported mode must reject before movement and cannot be a
direct/router/quoter/UI bypass. A structurally valid submission with inconsistent examples is not prototype-ready.

## Evidence status

Record each method as `planned`, `passed`, `failed`, `tooling-blocked`, `no-data`, `not-applicable-with-reason`, or
`inconclusive`. Include exact tool
versions, counts, fork block, useful invariant calls, reverts, gas, size, skips, and failures where applicable.

Track maintainer acceptance, platform review, deployment authorization, deployment execution, source verification,
runtime matching, lifecycle verification, monitoring readiness, routing/discovery, and availability as separate gates
with separate evidence.

Planned work is not test evidence.

After any source, compiler, dependency, launch-plan, configuration, documentation, or evidence change, use the
change-impact map in `references/submission-regressions.md` to invalidate and rerun every dependent result. Also
render-lint the decision: a blank, placeholder, malformed, or mixed-revision immutable identity cannot be published.
