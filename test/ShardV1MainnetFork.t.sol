/// @dev Every other Shards suite runs against a freshly deployed local `PoolManager`, which proves
///      the model's own logic but says nothing about whether it composes with the real v4 contract
///      the collection would actually market-make on. This suite closes that gap: it mines the hook
///      against the live PoolManager, atomically deploys and wires the token, hook, NFT and shared
///      renderer, seeds and initialises the locked position, then drives a third-party swap, a redeem, a hook-market
/// buy and sell, all three claim paths and a donation — asserting the backing invariant survives
///      every step. It also pins that the fork handed us the genuine PoolManager (by runtime code
///      hash), reproduces CREATE2 predictions, and checks Ethereum-native art-seed inputs.
///
///      It needs an archive RPC and so is kept out of the default `forge test` run in CI. Unlike
///      {ClassicV3MainnetForkTest}, which is excluded by `verify.yml`, this suite gates itself on
