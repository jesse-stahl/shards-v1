/**
 * What happens when the curve actually runs out.
 *
 * The shipped ticks put `tickLower` at `minUsableTick`, which makes exhaustion cost more ETH
 * than exists — every guard that fires on a short fill is unreachable there, and so is every
 * bug hiding behind one. That is exactly the argument the contract's own comments reject: the
 * backing identity has to be a property of THIS contract, not of whatever ticks
 * `Deploy.s.sol` happens to pass.
 *
 * So this fixture deploys the same hook over a DELIBERATELY SHALLOW range — 600 ticks instead
 * of ~1.77 million — where the whole 10,000 SHARD seed can be bought out for a few thousand
 * test ETH. Nothing else changes. The hook, the NFT and the fee logic are the shipped ones.
